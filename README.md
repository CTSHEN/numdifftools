= NUMDIFFTOOLS =
Suite of tools written in [http://www.python.org Python] to solve automatic numerical differentiation
problems in one or more variables. Finite differences are used in an adaptive manner, coupled with a Romberg extrapolation methodology to provide a maximally accurate result.
The user can configure many options like; changing the order of the method or the extrapolation, even allowing the user to specify whether central, forward or backward differences are used.

The methods provided are:

*Derivative:* Computate derivatives of order 1 through 4 on any scalar function.

*Gradient:* Computes the gradient vector of a scalar function of one or more variables.

*Jacobian:* Computes the Jacobian matrix of a vector valued function of one or more variables.

*Hessian:* Computes the Hessian matrix of all 2nd partial derivatives of a scalar
function of one or more variables.

*Hessdiag:* Computes only the diagonal elements of the Hessian matrix 

All of these methods also produce error estimates on the result.

A pdf file is also provided to explain the theory behind these tools.
